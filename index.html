                <h2>Basic protective measures against the new coronavirus</h2>
                    <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
                    available on the WHO website and through your national and local 
                    public health authority. Most people who become infected experience
                    mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for others</p>

                <h2>Practice respiratory hygiene</h2>
                    <p>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good 
                    respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
                    with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then 
                    dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread 
                    virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the 
                    people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

                <p>Wash your hands frequently</p>
                    <p>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based 
                    hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with 
                    soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may
                    be on your hands.</p>

                <h2>Maintain social distancing</h2>
                    <p>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and 
                    anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or
                    sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth 
                    which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in 
                    the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing 
                    has the disease.</p>

            <div class="col col-colorNew col-4">
                <p>If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek 
                    medical care early</p>
                    <p>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough 
                    and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in 
                    advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
