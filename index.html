                        <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak,
                        available on the WHO website and through your national and local 
                        public health authority. Most people who become infected experience
                        mild illness and recover, but it can be more severe for others</p>

                    <h2>Practice respiratory hygiene</h2>
                        <p>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good 
                        respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose
                        with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then 
                        dispose of the used tissue immediately. Why? Droplets spread 
                        virus. By following good respiratory hygiene you protect the 
                        people around you from viruses such as cold, flu and COVID-19.

                    <p>Wash your hands frequently</p>
                        <p>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based 
                        hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with 
                        soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may
                        be on your hands.</p>

                    <h2>Maintain social distancing</h2>
                        <p>Maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and 
                        anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or
                        sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth 
                        which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in 
                        the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing 
                        has the disease.</p>

                        <p>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough 
                        and difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in 
                        advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority.
