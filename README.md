## Intro

This website is one of the projects I created while taking the course "Introduction To Responsive Web Design - HTML & CSS Tutorial" by freeCodeCamp.

## Objective

Start to think responsively, thinking about the final layout of my website.

With the spread of the Coronavirus in 2020, I decided to use this topic for this responsive project, adding some tips to prevent the spread of virus and where to find information in many regions of the world.

## Next Steps

- Work on new Header layout. Desktop view and mobile view are good. We need to add another media where we can scroll down and see which pages to access.

- Still on Header, maybe add another element on header, like Lusalga image instead of Title and subtitle on the beginning of header.

- Deploy Website using Github Pages.

- To be Define later.
